## About

I've always enjoyed playing different versions of Heardle that I've found online, but always had to find different websites to play with different artists' songs, in addition to never having to ability to customize the list of songs. This was the driving force in creating Spotelfy, where you can play a heardle with any artists' library of songs or with any playlist that is available on Spotify, including your own!

Here's how to play: 

- Select the group of songs you want to guess from, whether it be an artist's catalog or a Spotify playlist.
- Play a snippet of the song to guess, revealing more of the song the more incorrect guesses or skips you make.
- Make your guess! View stats throughout your time playing including total games played, win %, highest and current streak, and a history of where your correct, or incorrect guesses have landed.
